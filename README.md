YouThought was made using the flask framework to render python which I use to optimize the backend portion of the program and basic html/css/js for front end. 
Essentially it is a screen time blocker without the blocking. If you are someone like me who often watches random YouTube videos and spontaneously types in "yout"... (enter) 
if you train your fingers and brain to impulsively type in you thought instead of YouTube you can override your brain wiring. 
It also is a chat bot to help you stop procrastinating and provides a guided conversation.
